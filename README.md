# C++14
## Features of C++ 14
### 1. Generic lambdas
A lambda is a concise way to define an anonymous function (closure) directly at the point where it is called or passed as an argument to a function. Typically, they are used to encapsulate short pieces of code that are passed to algorithms, where the code is not intended for reuse.

Letâ€™s say we create a lambda function to return the sum of two integers. The lambda function would look like this:
```c++
[](int a, int b) -> int { return a + b; }
```

But what if we needed to calculate the sum of two floating-point values later? In that case, we would need to create a new lambda expression for double values. 
Similarly, whenever the input types changed, the lambda function would have to be rewritten.

```c++
[](double a, double b) -> double { return a + b; }
```
C++14 eliminates this issue by allowing the use of the auto keyword in the input parameters of a lambda expression. This enables the compiler to deduce the parameter types at compile time. Therefore, in our previous example, a single lambda expression that works for both integer and floating-point values would look like this:

```c++
auto sum = [](auto a, auto b) { return a + b; };
```

### 2. Return Type deduction for functions
Let us consider the function template has at least two type parameters as mentioned below:
```c++
template <typename T, typename T2>
??? sum(T a, T2 b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
When a function template has at least two type parameters, the return type cannot always be determined automatically. However, in the case of sum, the return type should match the type produced by the arithmetic operation a + b.
In C++11 we can solve this by using auto in Combination with decltype.

```c++
template <typename T, typename T2>
auto sum(T a, T2 b) -> decltype(a + b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Using auto indicates that you don't know the type upfront and will specify it later. This specification is done using the decltype expression: decltype(a + b). 
The return type of the function template sum will be the type that the arithmetic expression evaluates to. 
However, you have to use the same expression, a + b, twice. This can be error-prone and redundant.

From C++14 onwards 
```c++
template <typename T, typename T2>
auto sum(T t, T2 t2) {
    return t + t2;
}
```
